            <pre>
                Virtual Reality is programs that allow a user to be immersed in an environment.
            These programs range from video games to work training simulations that allow a user
            to nearly get hands-on experience. I believe this innovation will become more and more
            the future. Entertainment can bring both new experiences or games that are a fun way 
            to get some exercise.
