            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <pre>
                    I love to experience all I can. My first semester of college involved starting the Tabletop Club at Lewis University. 
                As president, I had to find the most optimal days and times for scheduling events as well as decide how I would run my club.
                Tabletop meant a lot to me and does mean a lot to me. In highschool, I started off as a soccer player my Freshman and Sophomore
                years, but looked to do something different in my Senior year. One of my friends invited me to Tabletop Club, so I went to check
                it out. It ended up becoming one of the best decisions of my life as it was an opportunity to connect and make some of my closest
                highschool friends. As a new student at Lewis University, I wanted to bring that opportunity to connect and develop close 
                friendships to Lewis for me and for any potential members. 
                    In my first semester I would take on an even greater endeavor and perhaps even more profound. Excited about college, I wanted
                to find every opportunity I could to have my own college experience. I decided to look into fraternities. Alpha Eta Rho, the 
                aviation fraternity, got my attention. I thought it would be nice to explore the aviation culture at Lewis, as well as make use
                of the unique fact that Lewis is an aviation school. Whether I would go through a process, I did not know. Nonetheless, I went
                out to nearly every rush week event and decided why not go to the interview after a brother named Taisei said it was the best
                decision of his life to join AHP and that was where he made the strongest friendships. I got acceptance letter a few days after
                the interview. Again, I thought why not and went to the first couple of meetings. Pretty soon I began to feel a brotherhood with
                my fellow pledges and stuck the process out to the end. Now I am a member of AHP.
                    My family includes my dad, Dan; mother, Crystal; and sister, Allison. I also have a dog named Hunter, cat named Sanders, and 
                fish named Orangie.
                    My major is Computer Science. Since the age of 7 or 8, I was already fascinated by Computer Science and the opportunity in
                the field. Over time I changed from wanting to be a video game developer to wanting to contribute to causes important to me and
                perhaps be at the head of AI's development.

            <h2>What I Hope to Learn in this Course</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Working as a team in the field</li>
                <li>Making projects for browsers</li>
                <li>New environments to program in</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>My Favorite Hobby/Activity</h2>
            <pre>
                    My favorite hobby is art. For me this is anything from a project I made on my computer using AI art tools and PowerPoint to
                funny videos or songs I produced. Simply put, I enjoy making things for entertainment. Song writing is a very recent hobby of
                mine that I will explore more as I get the time to. 
            </pre>
            <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
            <pre>
                    One thing unique about me is that I am a Computer Science Major in an Aviation fraternity. I see this as a very valuable
                quality too. As the token, I have the opportunity to bring anyone together. This semester we have multiple non-aviation majors
                who will be entering the process because of my, in a sense, trail blazing.
