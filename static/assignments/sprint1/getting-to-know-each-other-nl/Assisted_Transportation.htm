                Assisted Transportation is the use of computers in transportation for the sake
            of managing transportation networks and improving driver experiences. Assisted
            Transportation includes cameras to be able to reverse safely, finding parking spaces
            and getting in them, collecting data to be used for civic engineering, weather
            -monitoring, traffic lights adapting to traffic patterns to increase flow, and much
            more.
