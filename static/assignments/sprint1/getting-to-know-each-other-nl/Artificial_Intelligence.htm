                Artificial Intelligence is a program that is able to carry out tasks normally only humans can. 
            It is able to learn from patterns and develop solutions or answers to questions.
                Artificial Intelligence has so much potential that the conception of it must be considered the
            most important invention. To begin, anyone can use AI now for writing help and creating art of their
            ideas. The fact that it can be used for creative expression will empower many people with great ideas
            to be able to express them. Second, AI is useful in science. Scientists can use AI to analyze patterns
            and, in the near future, AI will surely be solving complex problems. Finally, AI will provide great
            safety. I am sure someday it will be the solution to safe roads and transportation.
